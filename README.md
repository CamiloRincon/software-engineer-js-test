# Albumprinter test

This repository contains several different tests to be used for software engineer
vacancies. Each of the tests is in a different branch. Each of the branches contain
a basic setup for a JavaScript project. This ranges from either a simple index.html file
or to self contained NPM modules.

For each test see the README.md file

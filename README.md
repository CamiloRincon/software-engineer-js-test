# Albumprinter test

This repository contains a basic setup for a JavaScript project. You
will have the luxury of having a fully configured environment that can
build a web application. See "_System requirements_" below to get up
and running! The "_Project outline_" section walks you through a basic
rundown of the structure.

## The test

You will be working in an company where our customers will purchase a
printed product. As such your expertise should not be restricted to
developing applications, but also extend to understand the requirements
of print and how to translate between the app and the print world and 
vice versa.

### Goal

You should write a very simple application that should contain the
following:

1. A component that should be able to display text messages
2. A component in which the user can write a text message
3. A component that has a clickable button

Component #1 is the most "important" one: when the user writes text
in component #2 and clicks the submit button, component #1 must show:
 
    User has written "text"
     
(Where _text_ is replaced with the content component #2's input field.)

When the user clicks the button in component #3, component #1 will show:

    User has clicked the button!

Now the challenge is to make all these components in a manner that they
are *unaware of each other*.

In other words: component #2 does not know component #1 exists (and vice
versa!). How can you structure your code in a way that these components
work together as a whole? Your code should be written in such a way that
any of the components listed above could be a separate "mini-application"
that can be used in any context.

#### Deliverables

Out of the box, the application already provides you with an HTML template
that contains all visual components necessary:

 * div _#messageDisplay_ should be linked to component #1
 * div _#messageWriter_ should be linked to component #2
 * div _#buttonClicker_ should be linked to component #3

You don't have to use any package management technology (like Bower/NPM) to
separate the components into modules. It is enough to use file/folder structure
to separate your code.

It is NOT necessary to make this application look attractive. It
is about the _design of your code_, NOT the design of the application
interface!

You are free to use any libraries as you see fit (for instance to
retrieve form data / update HTML contents), but remember we are interested
in seeing you use _design patterns_, not your knowledge of libraries.
As such your applications logic should be written using your _custom code_ (in
other words: you're working without a framework, keep it simple, but keep
it maintainable).

Supply a little documentation on the components you have created. This
is about describing what the component does and how it could be integrated
within any type of application.

If you get stuck at any point, you can write "pseudo code", where you
basically explain in English what should happen at that point in the code.

Be prepared to explain the steps you took in a review of this test.

#### Rules

Once you receive this test by e-mail you must fork this repository to
your own GitHub account in which you will write your test.

Your application should run on the latest public version of Google Chrome.
You don't have to worry about making your code work on any other browser, as
such you are free to use anything that is supported by Chrome and not worry
about cross-browser implementations.

## Project outline

The entry point for your JavaScript application is _./js/main.js_. You can use the
CommonJS require/exports pattern to include dependencies. The build script
will ensure these get automatically built for use in your browser.

The project uses SASS as a preprocessor for writing your styles (though you can
write regular CSS inside a .scss file if you would like to). If you choose to use CSS,
you can use _./css/main.scss_ as your entry point SASS file.

All build output will be stored in the _./dist_ folder, this is
automatically generated by the build script and its contents can be ignored.

## System requirements

In order to build the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node, you will also have NPM available to you. NPM is Node's
package manager which will resolve dependencies for you.

In the root of this repository, you can resolve all these dependencies via
the command line using:

    npm install
    
You can now start developing the application using Gulp (build system/task
runner). by typing:

    gulp dev
    
The following will happen:

 * All JavaScript is included and built for the browser (you may use ES6)
 * All SASS styles are converted into CSS
 * Your browser will open and run the application
 * File watchers are started:
   If you add/remove/change HTML, SCSS or JS files the
   appropriate rebuild tasks are automatically run and your browser will
   be refreshed automatically. This allows you to instantly view the
   results of your changes.

You can add / remove / change files to in the source folder and your
browser will automatically update to reflect the changes.

You can of course use your favourite editor to edit your files.

# Albumprinter test

The goal of this test is to draw the following figure _using code_:

    X
    X X
    X X X
    X X X X
    X X X
    X X
    X
    
Note: the figure is not about literal "_X_"-characters, but about any kind
of Object that is aligned in the pattern above (you could use squares, circles, etc.)

You are free to use HTML and CSS for markup, but the _positioning and
generation_ of the pattern should come from JavaScript.

#### Deliverables

It is by no means necessary to make this application look attractive. It is about the
_design of your code_, NOT the design of the application interface!

If you are uncertain how to write the code for a certain part and get stuck: write _pseudo code_
that basically explains what _should_ happen to achieve the goal in context of the full application flow.

Also don't be afraid to show of your skills, even though this applications goal is a bit silly, imagine
it was a project that should be future proof, well maintainable, etc. How would you structure it?

Be prepared to be able to explain the steps you took in a review of this test.

#### Rules

Your application should run on the latest public version of Google Chrome.
You don't have to worry about making your code work on any other browser, as
such you are free to use anything that is supported by Chrome and not worry
about cross-browser implementations.

## Project outline

You will get an _./index.html_ file which has a simple template with a simple HTML document.
You can write your JavaScript code inside _./application.js_.

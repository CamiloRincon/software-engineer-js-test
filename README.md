# Albumprinter JS design pattern test

This repository contains a basic setup for a JavaScript project. You
will have the luxury of having a fully configured environment that can
build a web application. See "_System requirements_" below to get up
and running! The "_Project outline_" section walks you through a basic
rundown of the structure.

## The test

At Albumprinter we design software using a modular/micro service oriented
approach. As such, applications and their parts should be tightly decoupled.
This test will outline the design patterns you can use to achieve this
to demonstrate your skill.

### Goal

You should write the outline of a very simple application by creating
the following:

#### 1. Model

Create a simple model describing a human entity. It has simple properties such
as:

 * Name
 * Age
 * Sex
 
Structure your model in the way that you find appropriate. Will it need
a public interface ? What functions would you consider ? Etc.

#### 2. Observers / notifiers

Communication between modules is often achieved using a messaging system.
Create a simple Observer / notification pattern in which you can:

 * subscribe a handler to a specific messages
 * broadcast a message which is picked up by all subscribed handlers
 * unsubscribe handlers
 
#### 3. Asynchronous operations

When being reliant on different services, you will often be confronted
with asynchronous results. The purpose is to show a simple pattern in which
you rely on two asynchronous operations, and can wait for them.

You can quickly mock an asynchronous result by using setTimeout:

    // define a variable to hold a result
    var result1;
    setTimeout( function() {
        // result1 now has a value
        result1 = "foo";
    }, 500 );

#### Deliverables

It is not necessary to link your code to a visual interface, the point
is to write the application logic and be able to explain your decisions.

We all know and use Stackoverflow at one time or another, as such you are
free to use internet access for help. If you do get stuck in the implementation,
you can write down your proposed solution in pseudo-code, just be ready
to explain your choices.

## Project outline

The entry point for your JavaScript application is _./js/main.js_. You can use the
CommonJS require/exports pattern to include dependencies. The build script
will ensure these get automatically built for use in your browser.

The project uses SASS as a preprocessor for writing your styles (though you can
write regular CSS inside a .scss file if you would like to). If you choose to use CSS,
you can use _./css/main.scss_ as your entry point SASS file.

All build output will be stored in the _./dist_ folder, this is
automatically generated by the build script and its contents can be ignored.

## System requirements

In order to build the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node, you will also have NPM available to you. NPM is Node's
package manager which will resolve dependencies for you.

In the root of this repository, you can resolve all these dependencies via
the command line using:

    npm install
    
You can now start developing the application using Gulp (build system/task
runner). by typing:

    gulp dev
    
The following will happen:

 * All JavaScript is included and built for the browser
 * All SASS styles are converted into CSS
 * Your browser will open and run the application
 * File watchers are started:
   If you add/remove/change HTML, SCSS or JS files the
   appropriate rebuild tasks are automatically run and your browser will
   be refreshed automatically. This allows you to instantly view the
   results of your changes.

You can add / remove / change files to in the source folder and your
browser will automatically update to reflect the changes.

You can use your favourite editor to edit your files.
